                    &emsp; As this internship comes to a close, I believe it is appropriate to take some time to reflect on this summer experience. Going into this internship, my knowledge of computer science prior to the summer was limited to Java.
                    <br />
                    &emsp; Throughout the course of the summer, I have learned a great deal of new concepts. These new topics are not just limited to computer code. Along with learning proper source control, how to use html, css, and javascript to code a website, and setting up a database and communicating data throughout the model, I also grasped skills pertinent to the workplace. I believe these workplace skills to invaluable, more so than any of those related to fullstack development. Of these skills, communicating with both peers and superiors is probably most applicable to just about anything and everything. I found communication to be the key to success. In addition to communication skills, scheduling and time management were also valuable takeaways.
                    <br />
                    &emsp; As for the experience itself, I found it to be overall beneficial and eye-opening. As I mentioned before, I learned a many lessons and skills related to both full stack development and workplace ethics. I believe that the content learned is applicable and valuable, and that I would not be able to emulate the environment in which I acquired them anywhere else. That being said, as with all things, this internship had both ups and downs. There were a handful of times where I (and many others) found themselves bored/with nothing to do. There were times where tasks were tedious or frustrating. There was a lot of advanced topics that were difficult to grasps. But at the end of the day, I am proud of the final product, I am glad I took this opportunity, and I would not trade it for the world.
                    <br />
                    &emsp; Looking towards the future, I believe this experience will give me a leg up in any of my endeavors. Future opportunities will present themselves, and me already having experience in a full stack development environment will be ahead of the competition. As well as making me stand out, the internship has provided me with a few connections and networking paths that can aid me in future plans. And last, and probably (objectively) least, I have one-of-a-kind memories, stories, and talking points from this summer that I can cherish to my heart's content.
                    <br />
                    &emsp; Overall, this summer internship has been a huge positive. Thank you for providing this opportunity to learn and grow.
