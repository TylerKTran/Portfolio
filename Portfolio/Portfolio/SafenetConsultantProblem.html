                    &emsp; The Safenet Consultant Problem was a prerequisite to taking the internship. We were given a relativley easy prompt, but it required some foresight and planning. Our tasks had four functions for us to write.
                    <br />
                    &emsp; These functions consists of a restock, a withdrawal, an inquiry, and quit. Restock and quit were straightforward: just reset all instance fields and end the applicationr respectively. For the inquiry, I wrote a for each loop to display the requested denomination. The withdrawal took some calculating and bullet proofing in order to subtract the correct amount in the fewest number of bills. I also wrote a method that would evaluate the input statement and call the correct method.
                    <br />
                    &emsp; Translating this code from Java to C# was an entirely different story. C#, for the most part, has few syntax differences from Java. However, I did have to look up some commands and such. This was my first time working with C#, so I was going in with no knowledge what so ever. My greatest pains came from errors that did not exists in eclipse, specifically with the console immediately closing when running the program. To solve this I had to conduct some research and add some ‘Console.Readkey()’.
                    <br />
                    &emsp; I found the Safenet Consultant Problem easy, but the translating to C# a litte more difficult.
